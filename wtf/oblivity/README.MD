# What is this?
The download for oblivity

# For hostinger
If a hostinger staff is reading this, This is just a personal place for my own projects, Nobody else is needed to download it.
The reason why I removed and replaced the exe file is because I was trying to remove keyauth but failed, You can look at my old commit and download the file with keyauth.
Heres the repositery with keyauth showing that it has no harmful intentions https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example
I have provided the source code to said project that was flagging a lot of antivirus software, Download "Source Code.zip" it contains everything

This is what support told me:
